# blink-grocery-sales-data-dashboard

Hello everyone!!!

I am excited to share my personal project "blinkit Grocery Sales Data Dashboard" to provide important insights into business performance.
I used Power Query and DAX for Data Cleaning and Transformation, and Power BI for Data Visualization. I designed the dashboard attractively
to increase user comfort in understanding the data.

This project explores metrics such as revenue and sales by outlet type, category product, item type, fat content, and segment. In addition,
I also added forecasting to the sales and revenue data to strengthen decision making for stakeholders.
